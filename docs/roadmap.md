## ðŸ”Ž Finance Repo Peeks
This week, I also explored professional finance libraries to see how these concepts are used:
- [Riskfolio-Lib](https://github.com/dcajasn/Riskfolio-Lib): portfolio optimization with Python.
- [py4fi2nd](https://github.com/yhilpisch/py4fi2nd): code from *Python for Finance* book.
- [QuantStart Monte Carlo](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Monte-Carlo-Simulations-in-Python/): simulation approach for risk.
- [bt Backtesting](https://pmorissette.github.io/bt/): strategy backtesting in Python.
- [Open Source Risk Engine (ORE)](https://github.com/OpenSourceRisk/Engine): enterprise-grade risk analytics.

I only skimmed the code this week but will revisit after learning more fundamentals.
